    "text": "We sometimes need to write a word or name with an accent in a markdown document, e.g., café, naïve, façade, jalapeño, Scheffé.\nYou can do this by adding unicode characters to your document. Unicode is an international standard used to render language consistently on computers.\nTo add a unicode character in a markdown document:\n\nIdentify the decimal number of the character you want to include. Wikipedia has a nice list at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters.\nWhen you need to add the accented unicode character:\n\n\nUse &# to indicate the start of the unicode character\nWrite the decimal number of the character.\nUse ; to indicate the end of the unicode character.\n\n\nRender the document.\n\n\nHTML documents will render without issue.\nIf you are rendering to pdf, then you will likely need to change the latex engine to xelatex or luatex. In the YAML header, use something like:\n\noutput:\n  pdf_document: \n    latex_engine: xelatex\nHere are some examples:\ncafé is written as caf&#233;\nnaïve is written as na&#239;ve\nfaçade is written as fa&#231;ade\njalapeño is written as jalape&#241;o\nThis text:\n&#223; &#228; &#233; &#239; &#241; &#343;\n\n&#242; &#246; &#163; &#165; &#174; &#275;\nproduces the following output.\nß ä é ï ñ ŗ\nò ö £ ¥ ® ē"
