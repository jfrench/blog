I am a statistician and data scientist. I am currently the Director of Data Science at the University of Colorado Denver and an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences.

I am passionate about using statistics and data science to learn from data, developing software to help others learn from data, and training others to do data analysis.
