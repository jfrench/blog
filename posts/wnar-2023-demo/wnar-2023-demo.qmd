# Introduction

We can weave rich narratives with **formatted** text and equations like $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ very easily.

# Reproducible

We can put our analysis in an environment that ensures reproducibility.

# Added explanation

We can add videos discussing the analysis if we want.

# Code and Output

We can easily include code and the resulting output and graphics.

We load a necessary package.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

We can now create a plot.

```{r}
ggplot(faithfuld, aes(waiting, eruptions)) + 
  geom_raster(aes(fill = density))
```
